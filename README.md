# 🤝 Welcome to the ZS Org Projects

This repository is dedicated to showcasing and managing community-driven projects under the **ZS Organization**. We welcome passionate developers, learners, and tinkerers to share their projects with us and grow together.

## 🌐 Your Project on zsorg.us.kg

You can use our domain for projects under our org!

If your project includes a website, documentation, or demo, you can publish it at:

```
https://zsorg.us.kg/<your-repo-name>
```

### To enable GitHub Pages:
1. Create a folder in your repo named **`Web/`**
2. Add your HTML/CSS/JS files inside it.
3. In your repo settings, go to **Pages** → **Source**, and select:
   ```
   Branch: main (or master)  
   Folder: /Web
   ```
4. Your site will be live shortly at the custom domain!
